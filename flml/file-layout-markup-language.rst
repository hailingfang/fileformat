Introdution
======================

File Layout Markup Language (FLML) is a markup language for describing the
layout/structure of binary or plaintext text files.


FLML Sentence
=====================
A sample FLML sentence have three parts: [...], <...> and (...).
Where the '...' reprent the stataments the parts hold.

There is a example of a FLML sentence::

    [5]<int>(name="sample sentence")

The '[...]' parts is necessary for a FLML sentence. The '<...>' and '(...)'
can be omiited.

A complex FLML sentence use '{...}' replace the '<...>' part.

For example::

    [2] {
        [2]<int>
        [1]<double>
        [8]<uint8>
    }(name="comple sentence")

The '{...}' can contain another '{...}'. If the value expression in
"[...]" equals 1, the '[...]' part before a '{...}' part can be omiited.

A FLML sentence start with '[...]', end before other '[...]'. Any blank
char between '[...]', '<...>', '{...}' and '(...)' is ignored.


The Data Types in FLML
=======================================

Number
-------------------

A number in FLML can be a integer, float or char. A char is a 8-bits
integer, and parenthesized by **''**.

Example::

    [123]
    [3.14159]
    ['A']

String
--------------------

String data type is support in FLML. The string should parenthesized by
**""**
Example::

    ["hello world"]

List
------------------

A list date type in FLML works same as the list date type in Pythons.

Example::

    [list_d = [1, 3, "aa", 4.6]]
    [list_d[1]]
    [list_d.append("hello")]

Dictionary
-------------------

A dictionary date type in FLML works same as the dictionary date type in Pythons.

Example::

    [dic = {"aa": 3, "bb": "hello", 3: 5}]
    [dic["aa"]]
    [dic["cc"] = 12]


The Variable and Expression in FLML
=======================================

The Variable
-----------------------

A variable in FLML consists of English characters, numbers or '_', and
can not start with a number.

For example::

    [aa]
    [bb13]
    [_cCd]

The Expression
--------------------------

A expression in FLML is composed by literal, variables and operators. 

Example::

    [x = 3 * 2 + 1]
    [y = x**2]

Arithmetic Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The arithmetic operators'+', '-', '*', '/', '%' and '//' and '=' is supported.

Relational and Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THe supported relational operators are '>', '>=', '<', '<=', '==', '!='.

The supported logical operators are '&&', '||', '!'.

Example::

    [a = 3;
     a > 1 && a <= 3]

Bitwise Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The supported bitwise operators include::

    & bitwise AND
    | bitwise inclusive OR
    ^ bitwise exclusive OR
    << left shift
    >> right shift
    ~ one's complement

Example::

    [a = 31;
     a << 2]

The Statament
--------------------------

A statament is a expression end with ';' or other statament with a key work.
The ';' of last expression in '[...]' can be omiited.

Some Statament::

    return, assert, raise, continue, break, import
    if, for, while, goto


Built ins
==========================

Built in Functions
----------------------------

::

    sum(), len(), int(), str(), float()
    open(), byte_to_int(), int_to_byte()

Example::

    [ld = [1,2,3];
     sum_num = sum(ld)]

Built in Object
------------------------

::

    fileself, None


The '[...]' Part
=======================

The '...' in '[...]' is one expression or many expressions(stataments).
If a FLML sentence have a '<...>' or '{...}' part. The '...' must can be calculated
and rusult with a integer value.

The integer value indicate the number of element. The element is repeated by '<...>'
or '{...}'. For instance, '[3]<float>', mean 3 elements, the element type is float.

The other instance::

    [2]{
        [2]<int>
        [4]<double>
    }

Means that there are 2 elements, every element is composed by 2 int and 4 double.

The '<...>' Part
=======================

The '...' in '<...>' is element type. It is used to indicate the data bit length.
The element types include::

    bit
    byte
    char, int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int, int32, uint32, int64, uint64
    float, double
    string

In '<...>', the value of element or values of elements can compare with
a value or values.

Example::

    [1]<int; =19>
    [2]<char; =[5, 18]> 
    [4]<float; [2]=3.14>

The first line indicate the the value store in element should equals 19.
The second indicate that the stored values should same as [5, 18].
The third show the value should in third elemet of elements should equals to 3.14.


In '<...>', a variable can be introduced to refer to element or elements representd by
sentences.

Example::

    [1]<int; :x>
    [2]<char; :y>
    [4]<float; [2]:z>
    [2]<uint16, =[23, 44]; :w>

The first use variable x to refer to the element in the block. The second is same as the
first, by y is list data type. The third using z to refer to third element of elements
representd by the sentence. In the fourth,w is [23, 44]. 


The (...) Part
=======================

The '...' in '(...)' are labels. The labels is (key, value) pares.
The labels record the additional information beyond '[...]' and '<...>'.
can recode.

Example::

    [3]<int; =[1, 22, 333]>(name="magice number";
                            id="mag_num";
                            greatthan=0;
                            lesseqthan=1000)

The labels defined in FLML::

    name        string  Name of block represented by the sentence
    id          string  Identity of the block, the string should start with
                        English characters or '_'. 
    dsp         string  descripiton
    greatthan   number  the element should great than a specific value
    lessthan    number  the element should less than a specific value
    greateqthan number  the element should great equal than a specific value
    lesseqthan  number  the element should less equal than a specific value
    choices     {items...}  items the element can be
    elechoices
    elementnum  the value calculated in '[...]' is number of element in '<...>' or '{...}' 
    offset      the value calculated in '[...]' is offset from begain of file
    bytelen     the value calculated in '[...]' is length of byte of block
    bitlen      the value calculated in '[...]' is length of bit of block


The Condition Sentence
============================

The stataments in '{}' will performed if corressponding Expression is true.

.. code::

    [if (Expression)] {
        FLML sentences
    } [elif (Expression)] {
        FLML sentences
    } [else] {
        FLML sentences
    }

    //or

    [
        if (Expression) {
            stataments
        } elif (Expression) {
            stataments
        } else {
            stataments
        }
    ]

Example::

    [1]<uint8; :x>(name="data type of next block", chiose={1, 2, 3})
    [if (x == 1)] {
        [8]<int>
    } [elif (x == 2)] {
        [8]<float>
    } [else] {
        [8]<double>
    }


The loop sentence
=============================

For Loop
-----------------------

.. code::

    [for (Expression)] {
        FLML sentences
    }

    //or
    [
        for (Expression) {
            stataments
        }
    ]

Example 1::

    [8]<int; :x>
    [for (i in x)]{
        [i]<int>
        [2 * i]<float>
    }

Example 2::

    [1]<int; :x>
    [for (i=0; i<x; i++)] {
        [i**2]<char>
        [5]<int>
    }

Whild Loop
-----------------------

.. code::

    [while (Expression)] {
        FLML sentences
    }

    //or

    [
        while (Expression) {
            stataments
        }
    ]

Example::

    [x = 3]
    [while (x)] {
        [x]<int>
        [4]<int; []=32>
        [1]<uint; :x>
    }


The jump sentence
============================

.. code::

    [goto (offset)] {
        FLML sentences
    }

    //or
    [
        goto offset;
    ]

The offset if offset from file's begaining in byte.

Example::

    [x = 1024]
    [goto (x)]{
        [2]<int>
        [4]<float>
    }


Define functions
==============================

.. code::

    [fun fun_name(args, ...)] {
        FLML sentences
    }

Example::

    [fun decode(arr)] {
        arr_decoded = [];
        for (ele in arr) {
            arr_decoded.append(ele ** 2 // 2 )
        }

        return arr_decoded;
    }


Modules
============================

.. code::

    [import module_name]

Example::

    [import math]
    [x = [1, 2, 3];
     y = [];
     for (ele in x){
        y.append(math.sin(ele));
      }
     ]


Comment
============================

Segment comment
---------------------------

A sentence whose '[...]' part start with '#', the sentence is
regard as a comment.

For example::

    [# this is a comment]<int>()

Line comment
------------------------

A line start with '#', the line is a comment.

For example::

    # [3]<int>

Block comment
-------------------------

Contents within '/*' and '*/' are regard as comments.

For example::

    /*
        [3]<int; float_num>
        [float_num]<float>
    */
